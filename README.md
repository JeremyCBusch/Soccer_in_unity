# Soccer_in_unity

This is a simple game built in unity. I have never worked with any sort of game engine so I wanted to create a really simple game to get acquainted with them like unity and unreal engine. I plan on continuing to work on this to better strengthen my knowledge of C# and exercising my creative skills.

I was able to get a player controlled by the WASD keys and a ball that respawns once it goes into the goal. This was a simple game just to see how to create an environment and playable game. 

I wrote this software so I could learn as much as I can about Unity and how to create games with it. I also did this so that I could learn a little bit about C# and how it connects with the tools in Unity.
